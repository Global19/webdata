<p>The <em>Web Data Principles</em> are a simple set of guidelines about how to make structured information more useful on the Web. The <em>Web Data Principles</em> are a set of simple principles and patterns, and not a specific set of technologies. For a much more detailed set of recommendations, you might want to check out <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/">the W3C's "Data on the Web Best Practices" document</a></p>

<p>The <em>Web Data Principles</em> are more liberal than the <a href="http://5stardata.info/">5-star model of Linked Data</a>, which makes specific statements about required technologies. In addition, the <em>Web Data Principles</em> do not propose a hierarchy of stars. Each star can be awarded individually, and it is thus up to the providers of Web Data to decide which of the five principles they are following.</p>

<a href="linkable" name="linkable">
  <h3>Star One: Linkable</h3>
  <h4>★ Create and publish global and stable identifiers for resources.</h4>
</a>

<a href="parseable" name="parseable">
  <h3>Star Two: Parseable</h3>
  <h4>★ Use standardized metamodels so that representations can be easily parsed.</h4>
</a>

<a href="understandable" name="understandable">
  <h3>Star Three: Understandable</h3>
  <h4>★ Use well-known vocabularies/schemas so that understanding resources is well-defined.</h4>
</a>

<h3><a href="linked">★ Star Four: Linked</a></h3>

<p>For your documents to be a part of the Web, they should link to other documents whenever possible. Always use global identifiers when linking between documents, so that link identifiers can be taken out of context and shared globally.</p>

<h3><a href="usable">★ Star Five: Usable</a></h3>

<p>Label your document with a license, so that others know how they can use it. There are many licenses to choose from, and picking any one of those is better than not picking one at all.</p>
