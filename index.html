<p>The <em>Web Data Principles</em> are a simple set of guidelines about how to make structured information more useful on the Web. The <em>Web Data Principles</em> are a set of simple principles and patterns, and not a specific set of technologies. For a much more detailed set of recommendations, you might want to check out <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/">the W3C's "Data on the Web Best Practices" document</a></p>

<p>The <em>Web Data Principles</em> are more liberal than the <a href="http://5stardata.info/">5-star model of Linked Data</a>, which makes specific statements about required technologies. In addition, the <em>Web Data Principles</em> do not propose a hierarchy of stars. Each star can be awarded individually, and it is thus up to the providers of Web Data to decide which of the five principles they are following.</p>

<h3><a href="linkable">★ Star One: Linkable</a></h3>

<p>Documents need to have stable and discoverable global identifiers. Stability is required so that links to your document can be used as unique and global identifiers. Discoverability is required so that your documents can be found by others who want to link to them.</p>

<h3><a href="parseable">★ Star Two: Parseable</a></h3>

<p>Documents should use standardized data metamodels such as CSV, XML, RDF, or JSON, so that they can be easily parsed by consumers using standard software. Proprietary metamodels and formats need proprietary code for parsing, and thus are harder for consumers to process.</p>

<h3><a href="understandable">★ Star Three: Understandable</a></h3>

<p>Documents should use well-known or at least well-documented vocabularies/schemas, so that after parsing, interpreting the documents is possible and well-defined. At the very least, the vocabulary/schema must make it possible to discover links in documents, so that consumers can find and follow them.</p>

<h3><a href="linked">★ Star Four: Linked</a></h3>

<p>For your documents to be a part of the Web, they should link to other documents whenever possible. Always use global identifiers when linking between documents, so that link identifiers can be taken out of context and shared globally.</p>

<h3><a href="usable">★ Star Five: Usable</a></h3>

<p>Label your document with a license, so that others know how they can use it. There are many licenses to choose from, and picking any one of those is better than not picking one at all.</p>
