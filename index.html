<p>The <em>Web Data Principles</em> are a simple set of guidelines about how to make structured information more useful on the Web. The <em>Web Data Principles</em> are a set of simple principles and patterns, and not a specific set of technologies. For a much more detailed set of recommendations, you might want to check out <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/">the W3C's "Data on the Web Best Practices" document</a></p>

<p>The <em>Web Data Principles</em> are more liberal than the <a href="http://5stardata.info/">5-star model of Linked Data</a>, which makes specific statements about required technologies. In addition, the <em>Web Data Principles</em> do not propose a hierarchy of stars. Each star can be awarded individually, and it is thus up to the providers of Web Data to decide which of the five principles they are following.</p>

<a href="linkable" name="linkable">
  <h3>Star One: Linkable</h3>
  <h4>★ Create and publish global and stable identifiers for resources.</h4>
</a>

<a href="parseable" name="parseable">
  <h3>Star Two: Parseable</h3>
  <h4>★ Use standardized metamodels so that representations can be easily parsed.</h4>
</a>

<a href="understandable" name="understandable">
  <h3>Star Three: Understandable</h3>
  <h4>★ Use well-known vocabularies/schemas so that understanding resources is well-defined.</h4>
</a>

<a href="linked" name="linked">
  <h3>Star Four: Linked</h3>
  <h4>★ Link to other resources whenever possible.</h4>
</a>

<a href="usable" name="usable">
  <h3>Star Five: Usable</h3>
  <h4>★ Label your resources with a license, so that others know how they can use them.</h4>
</a>
