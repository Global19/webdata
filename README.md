# Web Data

Overview of the Web Data Principles.


## One Star: Linkable

Documents need to have stable and discoverable URIs. Stability is required so that links to your document can be used as unique and global identifiers. Discoverability is required so that your documents can be found by others who want to link to them.


## Two Star: Parseable

CSV, XML, RDF, JSON


## Three Star: Understandable

vocabularies/schemas


## Four Star: Linked

For your Documents to be a part of the Web, they should link to other documents whenever possible. Always use URIs when linking between documents, so that linked identifiers (URIs) can be taken out of context and shared globally.


## Five Star: Usable

Label your documents with a license, so that others know how they can use them. There are many licenses to choose from, and picking any of those is better than not picking one at all.
